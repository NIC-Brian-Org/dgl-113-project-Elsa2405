## Proposal

As the rapid growth of entertainment in general and also as a music lover personally, I plan to develop a music website which is published HTML CSS code on Git Hub by rajeevkrS for the project in DGL113 Introduction to JavaScript course. My plan is to create interesting and dynamic features in JavaScript that users can interact with in order to enjoy every moment listen to music, and turn a static website into a dynamic website.

Below are four features that I plan to implement:

1. Audio Player Controls: On the original website, users cannot interact with the music, so I will use JavaScript to create custom audio players with features such as play, pause, volume control, progress bar, and track navigation one by one. These controls allow users to interact with the music playback on the website seamlessly.
2. Favourite Playlist: Create dynamic playlists that allow users to add, remove songs by click to the liked icons, next and previous control in the . This feature enhances user engagement by giving them control over the content they listen to, creating a personalized experience.
3. Login with cookie: Create one more log in html page, use JavaScript to check cookie user if cookie exist, main page will appear component user account, if user does not log in, main page will show log in button.
4. Pop up notification: A response signal whenever users click on the buttons to let user be aware of what they are interacting with the buttons, in particular, liked button.

In conclusion, build an enjoyable and fun music website to increase user sastification is my oretation in this project. Though try to focus in detail but cannot avoid any mistake as I havenâ€™t using JavaScript to build a dynamic website before, I hope it will work well. Also, eagerly awaiting for your value feedback, comment and advices to make this project better. Thank you.
