## Proposal

As the rapid growth of entertainment in general and also as a music lover personally, I plan to develop a music website which is published HTML CSS code on Git Hub by rajeevkrS for the project in DGL113 Introduction to JavaScript course. My plan is to create interesting and dynamic features in JavaScript that users can interact with in order to enjoy every moment listen to music, and turn a static website into a dynamic website.

Below are four features that I plan to implement:

1. Audio Player Controls: On the original website, users cannot interact with the music, so I will use JavaScript to create custom audio players with features such as play, pause, volume control, progress bar, and track navigation. These controls allow users to interact with the music playback on the website seamlessly.
2. Dynamic Playlist: Create dynamic playlists that allow users to add, remove, and reorder songs. This feature enhances user engagement by giving them control over the content they listen to, creating a personalized experience.
3. Integration with APIs: Nowadays, many famous music libraries such as Spotify, SoundCloud, Youtube and so on that users want to access directly from one application, JavaScript can be used to integrate with various APIs such as music streaming services or lyrics databases. This integration allows users to access a wide range of music content directly from the website, enriching the user experience with additional functionalities.
4. Social Sharing and Interaction: There are couple of heart icon button on the original website that give me an idea to enriching user experience which is implement social sharing buttons and features such as comments or likes, enabling users to share their favorite songs or interact with other users. This fosters community engagement and encourages users to interact with the website beyond just listening to music.

In conclusion, build an enjoyable and fun music website to increase user sastification is my oretation in this project. Though try to focus in detail but cannot avoid any mistake as I havenâ€™t using JavaScript to build a dynamic website before, I hope it will work well. Also, eagerly awaiting for your value feedback, comment and advices to make this project better. Thank you.
